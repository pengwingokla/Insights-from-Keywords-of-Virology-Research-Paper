Understanding these dynamics is critical for preventing future pandemics and developing control strategies. This study aims to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wild mammals at the Belo Horizonte Zoo in Brazil, analyzing the virus's evolution and zoonotic potential. The study was conducted at the Belo Horizonte Zoo, Minas Gerais, Brazil, covering a diverse population of mammals. Oropharyngeal, rectal, and nasal swabs were collected from 47 captive animals between November 2021 and March 2023. SARS-CoV-2 presence was determined using RT-PCR, and positive samples were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Consensus genomes were classified using Pangolin and NextClade tools, and a maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred using IQ-Tree. Of the 47 animals tested, nine (19.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples included rectal, oropharyngeal, and nasal swabs, with the highest positivity in rectal samples. Three genomes were successfully sequenced, revealing two variants: VOC Alpha in a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and a fallow deer (Dama dama), and VOC Omicron in a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). Phylogenetic analysis indicated potential human-to-animal transmission, with animal genomes clustering close to human samples from the same region. This study highlights the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in various wild mammal species at the Belo Horizonte Zoo, emphasizing the virus's zoonotic potential and the complexity of interspecies transmission. The detection of different variants suggests ongoing viral evolution and adaptation in new hosts. Continuous monitoring and genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife are essential for understanding its transmission dynamics and preventing future zoonotic outbreaks. These findings underscore the need for integrated public health strategies that include wildlife monitoring to mitigate the risks posed by emerging infectious diseases.","zoos, sars-cov-2, wildlife, mammals, genomic analysis, zoonotic transmission, animal surveillance, viral adaptation, epidemiology, virology"

The role of epithelial tight junction proteins (TJPs) in hepatocarcinogenesis has been highlighted; however, the association of their expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HCC has rarely been reported. This study aimed to explore the role of peripheral claudin (Cldn)1 in liver pathogenesis and its crosstalk with soluble immune mediators in HCC prognosis. The study population included six independent subgroups: healthy controls, cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve HCV patients, DAA-SVR patients, and anticancer treatment-naïve de novo HCC patients. The laboratory tests included serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin, liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and CBC profiling. The serum levels of soluble cluster of differentiation (sCD)163, IL-10, and IL-12 were estimated by corresponding ELISA kits, whereas the levels of Cldn1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in PBMCs were quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Serum sCD163, IL-10, and IL-12 levels were significantly higher in the HCC patient group than in the control and non-malignant patient groups (P &lt; 0.0001). No significant difference was detected in the serum levels of the three markers between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, whereas their levels were significantly different between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients (P &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, the transcriptional levels of peripheral Cldn1 and TGF-β were significantly higher in patients with HCC and non-malignant cirrhosis than in patients without cirrhosis (P = 0.0185–&lt;0.0001 and 0.0089–&lt;0.0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between all the abovementioned markers and HCC (P = 0.0303 to &lt; 0.0001), which was further confirmed by the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which revealed an area under the curve (AUC) value ranging from 0.883 to 0.996. The calculated cutoff values demonstrated remarkable prognostic capacity, with ranges of 88–99.41% and 82.14–97.92% and positive/negative predictive values ranging from 84.62 to 98.3% and 92–98%, respectively. The proposed HCC predictors are novel non-invasive HCC biomarkers that maintain their predictive power under different pathological conditions and circumvent the drawbacks of conventional prognostic markers in patients with mild cirrhosis and/or normal AFP, albumin, and/or platelet counts.","hcv-related hcc, daa, claudin, scd163, cytokines, tight junction proteins, virology"

The study population included six independent subgroups: healthy controls, cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve HCV patients, DAA-SVR patients, and anticancer treatment-naïve de novo HCC patients. The laboratory tests included serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin, liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and CBC profiling. The serum levels of soluble cluster of differentiation (sCD)163, IL-10, and IL-12 were estimated by corresponding ELISA kits, whereas the levels of Cldn1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in PBMCs were quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Serum sCD163, IL-10, and IL-12 levels were significantly higher in the HCC patient group than in the control and non-malignant patient groups (P &lt; 0.0001). No significant difference was detected in the serum levels of the three markers between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, whereas their levels were significantly different between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients (P &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, the transcriptional levels of peripheral Cldn1 and TGF-β were significantly higher in patients with HCC and non-malignant cirrhosis than in patients without cirrhosis (P = 0.0185–&lt;0.0001 and 0.0089–&lt;0.0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between all the abovementioned markers and HCC (P = 0.0303 to &lt; 0.0001), which was further confirmed by the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which revealed an area under the curve (AUC) value ranging from 0.883 to 0.996. The calculated cutoff values demonstrated remarkable prognostic capacity, with ranges of 88–99.41% and 82.14–97.92% and positive/negative predictive values ranging from 84.62 to 98.3% and 92–98%, respectively. The proposed HCC predictors are novel non-invasive HCC biomarkers that maintain their predictive power under different pathological conditions and circumvent the drawbacks of conventional prognostic markers in patients with mild cirrhosis and/or normal AFP, albumin, and/or platelet counts.","hcv-related hcc, daa, claudin, scd163, cytokines, tight junction proteins, virology"

However, how the IFI16-STING signaling pathway is regulated by EMCV infection is still not well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the interaction between IFI16 and EMCV. Results indicated EMCV infection suppressed IFI16 expression in A549 cells. This study reveals that IFI16 plays an active role in combating EMCV. Screening viral proteins in conjunction with IFI16, we found that the EMCV VP2 protein hinders the antiviral response mediated by IFI16 by causing degradation of the IFI16 protein via the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.

Different types of HPV have varying carcinogenic capabilities, and viral load is one of the key indicators of pathogenicity. Currently, there is a lack of clinical data on HPV26. This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with HPV26 single infection. Exfoliated cervical cells were collected for HPV genotyping from women who attended gynecological outpatient clinics or physical examinations. The clinical characteristics of HPV26 single infections in both cross-sectional and follow-up studies were examined, and the association of viral load with HPV26 persistent infection and pathogenicity was investigated. The HPV26 positive rate among women visiting hospitals for gynecological medical consultation or physical examination was approximately 0.09% (379/435,072). Among the HPV types tested, the detection rate of HPV26 was 0.37% (379/103,608). In the cross-sectional histopathological study of 101 patients with HPV26 single infection, 62.37% (63/101) presented lesion-free. The numbers of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN2, and CIN3 were 25, eight, and five, respectively. Cervical cancer was not detected in any patient. 71 patients attended follow-up examinations as well as HPV26 retesting up to two years, during which, 28.57% (6/21) of CIN1 patients have developed into high-grade lesions, and 9.61% (5/52) of lesion-free patients have progressed to CIN stage. The viral load in the CIN group was significantly higher than that in the lesion-free group (p = 0.012). Similarly, the viral load in the persistent infection group was significantly higher than that in the viral-clearance group (p &lt; 0.001). The pathogenicity of single HPV26 infections is moderate among high-risk types, warranting the inclusion of HPV26 in expanded screening for HPV. High viral load is an important factor in the persistent infection and pathogenicity of HPV26.

Different types of HPV have varying carcinogenic capabilities, and viral load is one of the key indicators of pathogenicity. Currently, there is a lack of clinical data on HPV26. This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients with HPV26 single infection. Exfoliated cervical cells were collected for HPV genotyping from women who attended gynecological outpatient clinics or physical examinations. The clinical characteristics of HPV26 single infections in both cross-sectional and follow-up studies were examined, and the association of viral load with HPV26 persistent infection and pathogenicity was investigated. The HPV26 positive rate among women visiting hospitals for gynecological medical consultation or physical examination was approximately 0.09% (379/435,072). Among the HPV types tested, the detection rate of HPV26 was 0.37% (379/103,608). In the cross-sectional histopathological study of 101 patients with HPV26 single infection, 62.37% (63/101) presented lesion-free. The numbers of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN2, and CIN3 were 25, eight, and five, respectively. Cervical cancer was not detected in any patient. 71 patients attended follow-up examinations as well as HPV26 retesting up to two years, during which, 28.57% (6/21) of CIN1 patients have developed into high-grade lesions, and 9.61% (5/52) of lesion-free patients have progressed to CIN stage. The viral load in the CIN group was significantly higher than that in the lesion-free group (p = 0.012). Similarly, the viral load in the persistent infection group was significantly higher than that in the viral-clearance group (p &lt; 0.001). The pathogenicity of single HPV26 infections is moderate among high-risk types, warranting the inclusion of HPV26 in expanded screening for HPV. High viral load is an important factor in the persistent infection and pathogenicity of HPV26. Viral load is expected to serve as a screening risk factor for persistent infection and disease progression associated with HPV26.","human papillomavirus type 26, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, persistent infection, pathogenicity, viral load, virology"
